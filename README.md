# CarPricePredictionUsingR
This AI model predicts the price of cars using given features. This model uses the language R 
The JavaScript for this file is still under development as I am still figuring out how JavaScript works. I am trying to call the R model using JavaScript. I found one way which is to run the code in local host of my computer. The R model in itself works fine, but I also tries building a basic UI using HTML, which is why I am facing the problem. If you have any idea of how you can help me or if you have any resources, kindly reach out to me via email at raghavendrasharma02@gmail.com 
Hope this code is able to help you. 
The dataset is from Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/car-price-prediction-challenge
